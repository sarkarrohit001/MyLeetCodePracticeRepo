# MyLeetCodePracticeRepo

Hello I am Rohit Sarkar

Little bit about me I have a major in CS in my undergrads and I have passed out in the year 2015 from a Tier3 College.
DS and Algo Skills have been rusty over the years here I am trying to make an effort to make some changes to my own self.
This will be a repo that will store my daily / weekly problems that I will aim to solve in LeetCode.

Hoping for a better me.

Thanks
Rohit
